 * @name File
 * @description
 * This plugin implements a File API allowing read/write access to files residing on the device.
 *
 * The File class implements static convenience functions to access files and directories.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * import { File } from '@ionic-native/file';
 *
 * constructor(private file: File) { }
 *
 * ...
 *
 * this.file.checkDir(this.file.dataDirectory, 'mydir').then(_ => console.log('Directory exists')).catch(err => console.log('Directory doesn\'t exist'));
 *
 * ```
 *
 *  This plugin is based on several specs, including : The HTML5 File API http: //www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/
 *  The (now-defunct) Directories and System extensions Latest: http: //www.w3.org/TR/2012/WD-file-system-api-20120417/
 *  Although most of the plugin code was written when an earlier spec was current: http: //www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-file-system-api-20110419/
 *  It also implements the FileWriter spec : http: //dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html
